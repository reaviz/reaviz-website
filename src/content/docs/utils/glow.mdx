# Glow

The Glow effect in REAVIZ allows you to add a glowing effect to various chart components. 
For example, if you want to add a glow to a bar chart, you 
would add the glow prop to the `Bar` component. This can enhance the visual appeal of your charts and help to highlight important data points or elements.

### Where to use:
- **Highlight Data Points:** Ideal for emphasizing specific data points or chart elements.
- **Enhance Visual Appeal:** Useful for adding visual interest and improving the aesthetics of your charts.
- **Guide User Attention:** Great for guiding user attention to key areas of the chart.


## Examples
<StoryRenderer path="components/Glow.story.tsx" name="BarGlow" storybookKey="utils-glow--bar-glow" />
