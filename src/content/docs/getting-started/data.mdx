# Data Shapes

In REAVIZ, most charts use a `data` property to render their visuals. 
This data adheres to a generic `ChartDataShape` which can take on two different formats depending on the type of chart you are using.

### Chart Data Formats

- **`ChartShallowDataShape`**: Used for single-series charts like simple Bar Charts or Area Charts.
- **`ChartNestedDataShape`**: Used for multi-series charts like Stacked Area Charts, Grouped Bar Charts, etc.


Each of these data types defines a `key` and `data` property. 
The `data` property can either be a raw data type or a nested shape, depending on the chart. 
The raw data types, known as `ChartDataTypes`, include:


```js
type ChartDataTypes = number | string | Date | bigInt.BigInteger;
```
For more details, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/data/types.ts).

## ChartShallowDataShape

The `ChartShallowDataShape` is used for single-series charts. 
This format includes a straightforward key-value pair, along with optional metadata.

```js 
interface ChartShallowDataShape {
  // The key for the data point. Typically this might be a x-axis value.
  key: ChartDataTypes;

  // The data to render. Typically this might be a y-axis value.
  data: ChartDataTypes;

  // Additional metadata to pass to be used for tooltips/etc
  metadata?: any;
}
```

### Example: Single-Series BarChart

To use this data shape in a BarChart, your data might look like this:

```js
const data = [
  { key: 'DLP', data: 13 },
  { key: 'SIEM', data: 2 },
  { key: 'Endpoint', data: 7 }
]
```
This data structure is simple, with each object representing a bar in the chart.


## ChartNestedDataShape

The `ChartNestedDataShape` is designed for multi-series charts. 
Here, the data property is a nested array of `ChartShallowDataShape` items, allowing for more complex data representations.

```js
export interface ChartNestedDataShape {
  // The key for the data point. Typically used as the x-axis value.
  key: ChartDataTypes;

  // A series of data to render. Typically used as the x+y axis values.
  data: ChartShallowDataShape<ChartDataTypes>[];

  // Additional metadata to pass to be used for tooltips/etc
  metadata?: any;
}
```

### Example: Multi-Series BarChart
For a multi-series `BarChart`, your data might look like this:

```js
const data = [
  {
    key: 'Lateral Movement',
    data: [
      {
        key: 'XML',
        data: 100
      },
      {
        key: 'JSON',
        data: 120
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    key: 'Discovery',
    data: [
      {
        key: 'XML',
        data: 100
      },
      {
        key: 'JSON',
        data: 120
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In this example, our x-axis would show `Lateral Movement` and `Discovery` and then
a group of bar would contain `XML` and `JSON` with their respective values.

### Explanation
- **Single-Series Charts**: Ideal for charts with one set of data points (e.g., Bar Chart with one bar per category).
- **Multi-Series Charts**: Used when you have multiple data series per category (e.g., Stacked Bar Chart with multiple bars per category).

**Using these data shapes correctly ensures that your charts are rendered accurately and effectively.**
