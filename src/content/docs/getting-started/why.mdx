# Why Another Chart Library

Why create another charting library when there are already excellent options available, such as:

- [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)
- [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/gallery)
- [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis)
- [semiotic](https://github.com/nteract/semiotic)
- [data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui)

As we tried out these frameworks, we found that while each had its strong points, they also missed some features we needed. Whether it was a missing chart type, animations, or other functions, mixing and matching from different libraries often gave us inconsistent results.

Thatâ€™s why we decided to create our own charting library with these key ideas in mind:

- **Total Customization**: Make charts exactly how you want them.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and easy to understand.
- **Handles Large Datasets**: Manage and visualize big data smoothly.
- **Beautiful Design**: Create visually appealing charts that are easy on the eyes.

### Why reaviz is different
Even though there are other libraries, reaviz offers a unique mix of benefits:

- **All-in-One Solution**: No need to mix multiple libraries. reaviz covers it all, reducing inconsistencies.
- **Built on Trusted Tech**: Uses d3.js for data and Motion for animations.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API to help you create complex charts with less code.
- **Open Source and Community-Driven**: Free to use and constantly improving with community feedback.

We built reaviz to fill the gaps we saw in other libraries and to give developers and data scientists a tool that meets their diverse needs. Our goal is to help you make beautiful, functional, and meaningful visualizations with ease.

**We hope you enjoy our work!**
