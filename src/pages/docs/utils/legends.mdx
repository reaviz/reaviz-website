# Legends

REAVIZ supports two different types of legends:

- Discrete
- Sequential

Out of the box, none of the charts include legends because we want to
keep the library as modular as possible.

## Discrete Legend
The discrete legend is useful for categorical charts such as bar charts.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout. Below is a simple example of a
discrete legend that has four different labels.

### API
#### [DiscreteLegend](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegend.tsx)

#### [DiscreteLegendSymbol](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegendSymbol.tsx)

## Sequential Legend
The sequential legend is useful for categorical charts such as heatmaps.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout. Below is a simple
example of a sequential legend:
