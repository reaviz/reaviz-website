# Colors

---

Out of the box, reaviz has a variety of color
schemes that can be used to style your charts.
We have created a few custom themes and also added
all of the [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) palletes.

{Object.keys(schemes).map(name => (
  <>
    <ColorPaletteBlocks name={name} colors={schemes[name]} showNames={false} />
    <br />
  </>
))}
