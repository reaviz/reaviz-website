# Legends

---

REAVIZ supports two different types of legends:

- Discrete
- Sequential

Out of the box, none of the charts include legends because we want to
keep the library as modular as possible.

## Discrete Legend
The discrete legend is useful for categorical charts such as bar charts.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout. Below is a simple example of a
discrete legend that has four different labels.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={DiscreteLegendVerticalStories.Simple} />

### API
#### [DiscreteLegend](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegend.tsx)
<ArgTypes of={DiscreteLegend} />

#### [DiscreteLegendEntry](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegendEntry.tsx)
<ArgTypes of={DiscreteLegendEntry} />

#### [DiscreteLegendSymbol](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegendSymbol.tsx)
<ArgTypes of={DiscreteLegendSymbol} />

## Sequential Legend
The sequential legend is useful for categorical charts such as heatmaps.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout. Below is a simple
example of a sequential legend:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SequentialLegendHorizontalStories.Simple} />

### API
