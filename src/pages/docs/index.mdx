### What is reaviz?
reaviz is a set of beautifully designed, highly customizable, open-source React data visualization components
using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). 

### Why reaviz?
There are many React component libraries out there, but reaviz is unique in a few ways:

- **Highly Customizable**: reaviz is built on top of Tailwind CSS, which allows for a high level of customization and flexibility. You can easily change the look and feel of your components by tweaking the Tailwind classes. No longer are you locked into a specific design system or its opinions.
- **Seamless Animations**: reaviz uses Framer Motion for animations and transitions, which makes it easy to add motion to your components. You can create smooth animations with just a few lines of code.
- **Easy to Use**: reaviz provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to build modern web applications. You can quickly create beautiful UIs without having to write a lot of custom CSS or JavaScript.
- **Batteries-Included**: reaviz comes with a set of pre-designed components that you can use out of the box. This includes logins, reset password, manage team and more.
- **Battle-Tested**: reaviz is used in production on dozens of enterprise products and has been battle-tested in real-world applications.
- **Open Source**: reaviz is open-source and free to use and we plan to keep it that way. You can use it in your personal or commercial projects.
- **Real Code, Not Wrappers**: reaviz is built with real code, not wrappers around existing libraries. Everything from the select box to the radial charts are all part of the [reaviz](https://github.com/reaviz) portfolio.
