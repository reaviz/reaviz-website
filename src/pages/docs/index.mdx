## üìä What is reaviz?
reaviz is a collection of beautifully designed, highly customizable, open-source React data visualization components. It leverages the power of [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and the smooth animation capabilities of [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to bring your data to life.

## ü§î Why choose reaviz?
There are many React component libraries out there, but reaviz is unique in a few ways:

- **Highly Customizable**: Built on top of d3, reaviz offers a high level of customization and flexibility, allowing you to tailor your visualizations to your needs.
- **Seamless Animations**: With Framer Motion, reaviz ensures that your data transitions are smooth and visually appealing.
- **Easy to Use**: The simple and intuitive API of reaviz makes it easy to create beautiful charts without extensive custom coding.
- **Batteries-Included**: Pre-configured settings ensure that your charts look great from day one.
- **Battle-Tested**: Used in dozens of enterprise products, reaviz has been proven in real-world applications.
- **Open Source**: reaviz is open-source and free to use and we plan to keep it that way. You can use it in your personal or commercial projects.
- **Real Code, Not Wrappers**: reaviz is built with real code, not wrappers around existing libraries. Everything from the select box to the radial charts are all part of the [reaviz](https://github.com/reaviz) portfolio.
