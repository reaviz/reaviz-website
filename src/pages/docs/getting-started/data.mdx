# Data Shapes
The majority of the chart's in REAVIZ have a `data` property that they
use to render off of. This data shape comes is a generic `ChartDataShape` that
implements two different formats depending on the chart.

- `ChartShallowDataShape`: Single-series charts like a simple Bar Chart or Area Chart.
- `ChartNestedDataShape`: Multi-series charts like Stacked Area, Grouped Bar Charts, etc.

Each of the data types define a `key` and `data` property. Depending on the type
the `data` property might be a raw data type or a nested shape. This raw Data
type is called `ChartDataTypes`:

```js
type ChartDataTypes = number | string | Date | bigInt.BigInteger;
```

Reference: [src/common/data/types.ts](https://github.com/reaviz/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/data/types.ts).

## `ChartShallowDataShape`
The shallow data shape is used for single-series charts.

```js
interface ChartShallowDataShape {
  // The key for the data point. Typically this might be a x-axis value.
  key: ChartDataTypes;

  // The data to render. Typically this might be a y-axis value.
  data: ChartDataTypes;

  // Additional metadata to pass to be used for tooltips/etc
  metadata?: any;
}
```

If we were to implement this in a `BarChart` it might look something like this:

```js
const data = [
  { key: 'DLP', data: 13 },
  { key: 'SIEM', data: 2 },
  { key: 'Endpoint', data: 7 }
]
```

## `ChartNestedDataShape`
The shallow data shape is used for multi-series charts. Unlike the `ChartShallowDataShape`
the `data` attribute on the type is a nested `ChartShallowDataShape<ChartDataTypes>[]`.

```js
export interface ChartNestedDataShape {
  // The key for the data point. Typically used as the x-axis value.
  key: ChartDataTypes;

  // A series of data to render. Typically used as the x+y axis values.
  data: ChartShallowDataShape<ChartDataTypes>[];

  // Additional metadata to pass to be used for tooltips/etc
  metadata?: any;
}
```

If we were to implement this in a `BarChart` it might look something like:

```js
const data = [
  {
    key: 'Lateral Movement',
    data: [
      {
        key: 'XML',
        data: 100
      },
      {
        key: 'JSON',
        data: 120
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    key: 'Discovery',
    data: [
      {
        key: 'XML',
        data: 100
      },
      {
        key: 'JSON',
        data: 120
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In this example, our x-axis would show `Lateral Movement` and `Discovery` and then
a group of bar would contain `XML` and `JSON` with their respective values.
