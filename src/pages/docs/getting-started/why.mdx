# Why Another Chart Library

Why create another charting library when there are already excellent options available, such as:

- [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)
- [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/gallery)
- [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis)
- [semiotic](https://github.com/nteract/semiotic)
- [data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui)

As we explored various frameworks, we found that each one had its strengths but also 
lacked certain features that made them the perfect solution for our needs. Whether it 
was a missing chart type, animation capabilities, or other functionalities, combining 
components from different frameworks often resulted in a disjointed solution with 
inconsistent behavior.

This realization led to the creation of our own charting library, built on a foundation 
of key principles:

-	Complete customization
-	Integrity of data and interpretation
-	Capability to handle very large datasets
-	Aesthetically appealing design

We hope you enjoy our work!
