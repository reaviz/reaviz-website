# Why Another Chart Library

Why another charting library?There are some really good ones out there like...

- [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)
- [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/gallery)
- [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis)
- [semiotic](https://github.com/nteract/semiotic)
- [data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui)

As we tried out various different frameworks, each of them were missing one
thing or another that made them the PERFECT solution for us. Whether it was
a missing chart type or the way it was animated and so on. Mixing and matching
components from different frameworks to try and get that sweet spot will end up
in a hodge-podge solution with things working differently.

And thats how it started... As we built out these components we wanted to keep
a few basic principles:

- Provide complete customization
- Ensure the integrity of data and interpretation
- Ability to handle very large numbers and data sets
- Make sure it is aesthetically appealing

We hope you enjoy our work!
