Running the reaviz project locally is straightforward and simple. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

  ### Start the Development Server

```shell copy
  npm start
```

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can tweak the charts and see them build
and reload in real time.
### Building for Distribution
When you're ready to package the project for distribution, we use Rollup to bundle the code. Here's how to do it:
Run the build script to create the distribution files:
 - `npm build` 

This command will generate a dist folder containing the type definitions, bundled JavaScript, and CSS files.

**With these steps, you can easily set up, develop, and build the reaviz project locally. Happy coding!**
