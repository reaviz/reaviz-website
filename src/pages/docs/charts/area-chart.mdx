# Area Chart

An Area Chart or area graph are basically a line graph with the area
below the lined filled with colors or textures. Like line graphs area charts are
used to represent the development of quantitative values over a time period. It can also be used
to compare two or more categories and is similar to the Stacked Area Chart.

Area charts often used to show overall trends over time rather than specific values.

Types supported by reaviz:

- Single Series
- Multi Series
- Stacked
- Stacked Normalized

## Quick Start
To create a area chart, use import the `AreaChart` and give it `data`. The chart
will automatically configure itself with the default options exposed via `props`.

```jsx
import { AreaChart } from 'reaviz';

const MyChart = () => (
  <AreaChart
    height={300}
    width={300}
    data={[
      { key: new Date('11/29/2019'), data: 13 },
      { key: new Date('11/30/2019'), data: 13 },
      { key: new Date('12/1/2019'), data: 13 },
    ]}
  />
);
```
