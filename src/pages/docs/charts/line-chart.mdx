# Line Chart

A Line chart depicts data using points connected by lines, emphasizing trends and changes over a continuous set of values,
typically along an x-axis and a y-axis.

- Shows trends, changes, or relationships over time or continuous data points.
- Ideal for visualizing data sets with many data points and identifying patterns or trends.
- Offers a clear representation of fluctuating data or comparisons between multiple sets.
- Allows easy interpretation of data points and their relationships through the line's path.

Types supported by reaviz:
- Single Series
- Multi Series
- Radial

## Quick Start
To create a line chart, use import the `LineChart` and give it `data`. The chart
will automatically configure itself with the default options exposed via `props`.

```jsx
import { LineChart } from 'reaviz';

const MyChart = () => (
  <LineChart
    height={300}
    width={300}
    data={[
      { key: new Date('11/29/2019'), data: 13 },
      { key: new Date('11/30/2019'), data: 13 },
      { key: new Date('12/1/2019'), data: 13 },
    ]}
  />
);
```
